This notebook is used to illustrate:

1. Not every dollar invested in a share of stock is equal in terms of risk and reward.
2. Investors can use the tool of options to control the risk and reward of their investment.
3. For example, an investor can establish a "virtual" emergency fund even when they hold a long position with their entire investment portfolio.

This notebook assumes the reader is familiar with options and the chart showing stock price - option return relations.
